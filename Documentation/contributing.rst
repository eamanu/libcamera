libcamera is developed as a free software project and welcomes contributors.
Whether you would like to help with coding, documentation, testing, proposing
new features, or just discussing the project with the community, you can join
our official public communication channels, or simply check out the code.

Source Code
-----------

libcamera is in early stages of development, and no releases are available yet.
The source code is available from the project's `git tree`_, hosted by `LinuxTV`_.

.. code-block:: shell

  $ git clone git://linuxtv.org/libcamera.git

Documentation
-------------

Project documentation is created using `Sphinx`_.  Source level documentation
uses `Doxygen`_.  Please make sure to document all code during development.

Sphinx integration with Doxygen is planned, likely using `Breathe`_ and
`Exhale`_.
